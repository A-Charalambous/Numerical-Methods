# Linear interpolation is straightforward and computationally inexpensive. It's a good choice as a quick and simple method and provides a reasonable approximation.
# For small datasest with relatively linear behavior between points, linear interpolation is often sufficient.
# If the data is monotonic and we need to preserve this property, linear interpolation is suitable since it won't introduce oscillations.
